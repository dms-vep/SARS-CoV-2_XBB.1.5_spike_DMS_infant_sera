## Overview
This website hosts interactive visualizations of the results reported in **Dadonaite et al (2025) [add citation]**, which is a study led by Bernadeta Dadonaite in the [Bloom lab](https://jbloomlab.org/) in collaboration with [Mary Staat's group](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/s/mary-staat).

The study involves using pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to measure how mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 spike affect neutralization by sera from four different groups representing different exposure histories:
 1. *Wuhan-Hu-1-imprinted and XBB\* infected adult sera*
 2. *Wuhan-Hu-1 imprinted and XBB\* infected children sera*
 3. *primary XBB\* infection infant sera*
 4. *XBB\* infected and vaccinated infant sera*

The links in the four boxes above provide links to different ways to visualize the results.
For the simplest overview of the data, see the [Average escape for each serum group](average){target="_self"}.
The other boxes provide additional self-explanatory views of the data.
