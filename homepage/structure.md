# Structure-based visualizations

[Click here](https://dms-viz.github.io/v0/?data=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdms-vep%2FSARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fresults%2Fdms-viz%2Fdms-viz.json&e=imprinted_adults_escape&fi=%257B%2522ACE2_binding%2522%253A-2%252C%2522spike_mediated_entry%2522%253A-2%257D) for an interactive structure-based visualization of the sites of escape rendered with [dms-viz](https://dms-viz.github.io/dms-viz-docs/).

In the visualization linked above, the line plot summarizes the escape at each site, and clicking on sites shows their locations on the structure.
The toolbar at left provides various options about how to visualize the data.
The structure is [PDB 8iot](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8IOT), which is the XBB.1 spike trimer with all RBDs in the down conformation.
