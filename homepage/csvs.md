# Numerical data

The numerical data are available at the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera](https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera).

Here are summaries of the data after applying our suggested filtering for high confidence measurements:

 - [average escape for each mutation for each serum group](https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera/blob/main/results/summaries/sera_group_avgs.csv) (this is probably the file you want if you are looking for the data in the main figures of the paper for this study)
 - [per-serum escape for the Wuhan-Hu-1 imprinted and XBB\* infected adult sera](https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera/blob/main/results/summaries/WuhanHu1_imprinted_and_XBB_infected_adult_sera_per_antibody_escape.csv)
 - [per-serum escape for the Wuhan-Hu-1 imprinted and XBB\* infected children sera](https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera/blob/main/results/summaries/WuhanHu1_imprinted_and_XBB_infected_children_sera_per_antibody_escape.csv)
 - [per serum escape for the primary XBB\* infection infant sera](https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera/blob/main/results/summaries/primary_XBB_infection_infant_sera_per_antibody_escape.csv)
 - [per serum escape for the XBB\* infected and vaccinated infant sera](https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_XBB.1.5_spike_DMS_infant_sera/blob/main/results/summaries/XBB_infected_and_vaccinated_infant_sera_per_antibody_escape.csv)

The repository above also has additional unfiltered data that you are welcome to explore.
